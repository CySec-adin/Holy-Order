## Overview of Smite
In this section there will be write ups and pentest reports that I am allowed to share. Most will be of systems that I have done on HackTheBox or TryHackMe. I am doing this as in the past I have taken notes but never really tried to write a report style write up for the machines, and realize this is something I should do both as practice and to show my abilities in this area. If anyone has possible critiques that could help me improve, I would definitely appreciate it!

Going forward I will start putting my write ups here. I have done quite a few machines in the past so I will only be covering what I have done recently. A lot of these first ones will be computers in the PNPT courses, starting with the challenge machines for the Windows Privilege Escalation Capstone Challenge computers.

## Rules, Organization, Etc
1. When it comes to single stand alone machines, they are usually meant to show specific weaknesses as practice - therefore they will not be full blown pentest reports, and will mostly just highlight the way I exploited the system
2. I will always include an executive summary at the start to give a brief overview of the path I took, and then go into details with screen captures.
3. I will end with recommendations to mitigate the exploits found, and include anything I found that prevented me from doing what I wanted to do (AV, shell removal) as in the real world these could alert a user that something malicious is happening and is a good thing to show.
4. Standalone machines will not be represented as full testing of the system as there may be other things in the system to find, and my goal with those are to practice what is meant to be practice and not be exhaustive as time is limited when it comes to self study.
5. I will also include towards the end anything I learned if this was a practice/lesson, besides the obviously already explained exploit
