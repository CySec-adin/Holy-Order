# Artic - Its getting Cold...Fusion outside

<img src="https://media.tenor.com/0LhHcz68DMYAAAAM/cold-water.gif">

## Introduction
This machine was a part of the PNPT training course Windows Privilege Escalation - however it also highlights an initial vulnerability to get into the system

## Executive Summary

After initially scanning the machine with nmap and other tools, I was able to find a ColdFusion instance and admin login page. I found an existing metasploit module to exploit a vulnerability in the ColdFusion to get a low level shell on the system. I was then able to upgrade my shell to a meterpreter shell, which allowed me to enumerate the system further and find a kernel exploit to elevate my privileges to system, completely taking control of the machine.

Scanning with nmap revealed a few open ports, when visiting the web server running on port 8500 I was presented with an index page. Using gobuster I was able to find an admin login page for Cold Fusion, version 8

Searching through metasploit modules I was able to find an exploit to work for the version of Cold Fusion, and was also able to check for the directory needed to be attacked due to the index of the whole Cold Fusion directory being exposed. The exploit gained me a low level shell on the system (non-meterpreter). A meterpreter shell was first attempted with the exploit but was unattainable through the intial exploit. The shell gave me access to the account artic/tolis - a low level user - as shown below.

Metasploit module: windows/http/coldfusion_fckeditor

exposed directory:

## Privilege Escalation

Once in the system I was able to do a little enumeration of the system. I found the potential for a potato attack on the system due to privileges of the low level account, however I did not go this route and only explored it briefly.

I then decided to try and upgrade my shell to a meterpreter shell, so that I could do more post exploitation enumeration of the system, and to test if there was an AV or some other security measure blocking the use of meterpreter. I was able to gain a meterpreter shell and run the post exploitation Local Exploit Suggester Module from metasploit (multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester).

With the Local Exploit Suggester I was able to find multiple potential kernel exploits to gain system level access, however I pursued the exploit ms10_092: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2010/ms10-092 

Using this exploit, I had to migrate my meterpreter shell to a x64 process to execute the exploit, and was able to get system level access via the metasploit module (windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator) for this vulnerability. NOTE: the first screen capture is an error which let me know I needed to migrate to a different process first.

With this exploit successfully completed, I was able to gain full access to the machine.
